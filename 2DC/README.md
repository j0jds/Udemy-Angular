# 2DC

This project is an advanced exploration of dynamic components in Angular, developed as part of the Udemy course "Curso de Angular v2 ao v17: BÃ¡sico ao Profissional."

## Project Overview

2DC features dynamic cards and demonstrates the use of various Angular concepts to create a flexible and interactive user interface. The project is designed to deepen understanding of Angular's core features by implementing dynamic content and interactivity within components.

## Features

- **Dynamic Cards**: Implementation of dynamic components that adapt based on the input data.
- **Reusable Components**: Creation of components that can be reused throughout the application for consistent and maintainable code.

## Key Angular Concepts

- **Components**: Fundamental building blocks of Angular, allowing the creation of reusable and dynamic HTML elements in the application.
  
- **Property Binding**: Enables the dynamic updating of HTML element properties based on values in the component class.

- **Event Binding**: Facilitates responding to user events, such as clicks or key presses, by executing specific actions defined in the component.

- **Attribute Binding**: Allows dynamic manipulation of HTML element attributes, enabling adaptive user interface behavior as needed.

- **Style Binding**: Provides the ability to dynamically apply CSS styles to HTML elements based on values in the component class.

- **Class Binding**: Eases the dynamic addition of CSS classes to HTML elements, offering flexibility in styling the user interface.

- **@Input (Decorator)**: Enables communication between parent and child components, passing data from the parent to the child component.

- **@Output (Decorator)**: Facilitates communication between child and parent components, allowing child components to send data back to the parent.

- **Duplicated Code**: Emphasizes the importance of avoiding code duplication through the practice of componentization, promoting code reuse and maintainability.

## Learning Objectives

- Gain hands-on experience with dynamic component creation in Angular.
- Understand and apply key Angular concepts to build a more interactive and responsive user interface.
- Learn best practices in code reuse and component-based architecture.
